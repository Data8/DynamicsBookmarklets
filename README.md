# Dynamics Bookmarklets
Bookmarklets to simplify using Microsoft Dynamics CRM

## Importing Bookmarklets

1. Download the [dynamics-bookmarklets-Admin.html], [dynamics-bookmarklets-Navigation.html] and [dynamics-bookmarklets-Records.html] files
1. In Internet Explorer:
  1. File > Import and Export...
  1. Select "Import from a file" and click Next
  1. Select "Favourites" and click Next
  1. Select the first file to import and click Next
  1. Select a folder in your Favourites to import into and click Import
  1. Repeat for the remaining files
1. In Chrome:
  1. Menu > Bookmarks > Import bookmarks and settings...
  1. Select "Bookmarks HTML File" and click Choose File
  1. Select the first file to import and click Finished
  1. Repeat for the remaining files

As there are a large number of bookmarklets we recommend you import each file into a separate folder of your favourites to make it easier to
find the one you want.

## Using Bookmarklets

Each bookmarklet essentially extends the menu system of Microsoft Dynamics CRM and will run in the context of the page you have open.
Just open the relevant record or page in your CRM system and select the bookmarklet from your favourites list. Quick tip: if you're using
Internet Explorer and your favourites aren't visible, just press `Ctrl+I` to show them.

We've broken the bookmarklets into three groups to help you find the one you need:

## Admin

## Navigation

## Records
